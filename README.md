Hello!
This is a repository of Python scripts I found interesting and worthwhile sharing with the world. Nothing special or specific. 

# cyclical_figurate_numbers_61.py
This is my solution for Project Euler's problem 61. This script is my first self-made backtracking program. I thought it was a
particularly neat and efficient solution, as I found nothing like it when researching other's solutions online.

# conversions.py
This script contains numerous conversion type functions I've written, mainly encryption and math related.

# multiply_to_n.py
This script contains a function that, given a positive integer n, returns all possible ways k positive integers can multiply to 
give n as set of tuples. Efficiency decreases greatly when k >= 7, though the function works greak for most practical applications.
