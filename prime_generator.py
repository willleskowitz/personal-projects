        '''Efficient prime generator. This method uses a sieve that
        grows as the more primes are generated and removes unneeded entries
        to minimize memory use. This approach can generate a million primes
        in 2.9 seconds on my machine.
        
        This function is based off a submission by user tzot from StackOverflow,
        with some of my own meaningful improvements to further improve efficiency.
        The original function exploited the fact that all primes above 5 can be
        written in the form p = c*k + i (c = 30 = 2*3*5) where k is a nonnegative
        integer and 0<i<c such that gcd(i, c) = 1. Representing primes this way 
        increases generation efficiency by avoiding multiples of 2, 3, and 5.
        
        Conveniently, more multiples can be avoided by increasing the constant c.
        If c = 2*3*5*7 = 210, all multiples of 7 can be avoided.
        Furthermore, if c = 2*3*5*7*11, all multiples of 11 can be avoided,
        and so on. The form p = c*k + i such that 0<i<c and gcd(i, c) = 1 holds
        true. Note that primes that are a factor of c cannot be represented
        this way.
        
        I implemented this fact into the algorithm to improve generation
        speeds. The sweet spot for generating a million primes seems to be
        with c = 2310, though different generation goals may benefit
        from different c values. I hope you find this useful!'''
