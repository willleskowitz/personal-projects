Hello!
This is a repository of Python scripts I found interesting and worthwhile sharing with the world.

### prime_generator.py
This script contains my attempts at creating an efficient infinite prime generator. My best run generated a million primes in 2.9 seconds
on my machine.

### cyclical_figurate_numbers_61.py
This is my solution for Project Euler's problem 61. This script is my first self-made backtracking program. I thought it was a
particularly neat and efficient solution, as I found nothing like it when researching others' solutions online.

### conversions.py
This script contains numerous conversion-type functions I've written, mainly encryption and math related.

### multiply_to_n.py
This script contains a function that, given a positive integer n, returns all possible ways k positive integers can multiply to 
give n as set of tuples. Efficiency decreases greatly when k >= 7, though the function works well for most practical applications.
