        '''Efficient prime generator. This method uses a sieve that
        grows as the more primes are generated and removes unneeded entries
        to minimize memory use. This approach can generate a million primes
        in around 3.2 seconds on my machine.
        
        
        This function is based off a submission by user tzot from StackOverflow,
        with some minor changes. First, mod was a hardcoded frozenset of integers. Albeit
        this is more efficient, but it fails to explain the rationale behind it.
        This part of the code is exploiting the fact that all primes above 30
        (2*3*5) can be written in the form 30*k + i where k is a natural number 
        and 1<i<30 such that gcd(i,30) = 1. Representing primes this way increases
        generation efficiency by avoiding multiples of 2, 3, and 5.
        
        Second, skip was a hardcoded tuple of fifteen 1's and 0's for the cycle function.
        Instead, I included a list comprehension representing the logic of this 
        variable. For a prime p where p >= 7, p % 30 = i such that gcd(i,30) = 1. 
        This becomes evident when reviewing the representation p = 30*k + i.
        Therefore, any numbers not in this format can be skipped. Hence, skip
        represents this in a format thecycle function can read to filter these
        cases. This can be cycled since i remains the same as k increases.
        
        Lastly, the entries {9: 3, 25: 5} were removed from the sieve as they would
        never be use since the filter skips multiples of 3's and 5's as mentioned above.
        
        Any other changes made were for readability. I hope you find this useful!'''
